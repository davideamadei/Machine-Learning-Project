# Machine-Learning-Project
We provide a NumPy-only implementation of Neural Networks with a central focus on extendability. We tried to add make each class as independent as possible to favor readability.

General conventions:
- for documentation we used [pydoctor](https://github.com/twisted/pydoctor)
- for code formatting we used [black](https://github.com/psf/black)
